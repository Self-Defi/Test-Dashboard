      <h2>Canonical Image Prompt (SoT)</h2>
      <pre>A high-fidelity system architecture visualization of a &quot;AI automation system&quot; designed to solve:
&quot;I want to build a dashboard to track my receivables and expenditures form my clothing company&quot;

STYLE (locked):
- Dark technical HUD interface on a subtle square grid background (like an ops / infrastructure diagram)
- Clean metallic panels with soft inner shadows, faint neon edge glow
- High contrast, low saturation, engineered and deterministic (NOT artistic)
- Minimal color accents only: cool blue/cyan + optional small amber indicators
- Crisp typography, sharp lines, professional documentation-grade

LAYOUT (locked):
- 16:9 landscape
- Title centered at top (short, technical)
- Four vertical lanes (left-to-right), each with a header bar:
  1) INPUTS
  2) PROCESSING &amp; LOGIC
  3) AUTOMATION
  4) OUTPUTS
- Boxes stacked within lanes, connected with clear arrows (left-to-right flow)
- Optional bottom band: &quot;Databases&quot; or &quot;On-Chain / Storage&quot; with 3–4 small database icons

CONTENT RULES (locked):
- Each box label is 1–3 words max (e.g., &quot;Lead Enrichment&quot;, &quot;Workflow Automation&quot;)
- Use simple monochrome line icons inside some boxes (email, web, shield, database, charts)
- No people, no characters, no scenery, no abstract art
- No branding, no logos, no marketing copy, no UI mockups/screenshots
- This is an architecture diagram suitable for a GitHub README / technical documentation

RENDERING:
- Photorealistic lighting is NOT required; it should look like a premium digital infographic / architecture plate.
- Keep it consistent and repeatable across different thoughts.</pre>
      <h3>Negative Prompt</h3>
      <pre>Avoid:
- White backgrounds, colorful cartoons, hand-drawn sketches
- 3D scenes, people, mascots, faces
- Marketing posters, product UI mockups, website screenshots
- Abstract concept art, messy layouts, cluttered text paragraphs
- Overly saturated neon rainbow palettes
- Long labels, dense sentences in boxes</pre>
